The game features a caveman who is being attacked by creatures. The goal of the game is to kill all the invading aliens with
an axe before even one of them reaches the edge of the screen. The axe follows a line that the player draws with his hand,
starting from the point where the caveman stands and when the axe finishes its path, it returns to the caveman so that he can
throw it again. If the player attempts to kill all the creatures, he proceeds to the next level.
